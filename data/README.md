| Data  | Source | Description | 
|-------|----------|----------|
| [DTI](data/DTI/) | [BIOSNAP](http://snap.stanford.edu/biodata/datasets/10002/10002-ChG-Miner.html)| A drug-target interaction network betweeen 5,018 drugs that target 2,325 proteins with 15,139 interactions. The drugs are from the US market.| 
| [DDI](data/DDI/) | [BIOSNAP](http://snap.stanford.edu/biodata/datasets/10001/10001-ChCh-Miner.html)| A drug-drug interaction network betweeen 1,514 drugs with 48,514 interactions, which are approved by the FDA.| 
| [PPI](data/PPI/) | [HuRI](http://www.interactome-atlas.org)| A protein-protein interaction network from the Human Reference Protein Interactome Mapping Project. We use the HuRI-III version from the [L3 paper](https://zenodo.org/record/2008592#.XrYUlpNKjOR). It consists of 5,604 proteins with 23,322 interactions. |  
| [GDI](data/GDI/) | [DisGeNET](https://www.disgenet.org)| A disease-gene association network betweeen 9,413 genes and 10,370 diseases with 81,746 associations, which are curated from GWAS studies.|
